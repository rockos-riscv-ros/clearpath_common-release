  * Add the A200 Observer backpack attachment (#122 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_common/issues/122>)
    * Add the A200 Observer backpack attachment
  * [clearpath_platform_description] Fixed Ridgeback R100 rear light colour. (#127 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_common/issues/127>)
  * Add PTZ sim support (#125 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_common/issues/125>)
    * Now that axis_camera is released via OSRF, depend on the official package, remove duplicate meshes
    * Rename Gazebo plugins for Jazzy compatibility
    * Modify Axis camera URDFs to using the axis_camera meshes. This lets us control the gazebo topics. Fix the GZ topic names. Camera data is now visible in the simulation
    * Add joint controllers for the pan & tilt actuators. This provides velocity control over the simulated camera
  * Add a placeholer URDF for the AMP mount, update meshes (#123 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_common/issues/123>)
    * Add a placeholer URDF for the AMP mount; STL & final dimensions to come at a later date
    * Default to treaded wheels, flip all the wheel models so the treads visually go in the correct direction
    * Update the top plate, chassis, livery, smooth wheel, and status light meshes. Closes CPE87-2102
    * Catch unsupported platforms/accessories in vcan generation tests
  * A300 (#118 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_common/issues/118>)
    * Add A300 meshes
    * Move A300 meshes
    * Add A300 URDF
    * Added A300 control configuration files
    * Remove unstamped parameter, deprecated
    * Use clearpath_hardware_interface LynxHardware

  * Remove all references to clearpath_platform
  * Add collision tags for MoveIt to avoid these objects (#108 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_common/issues/108>)
  * Update simulation support for Jazzy (#117 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_common/issues/117>)
    * Rename gazebo plugins to use new gz nomenclature instead of ign/ignition. Use stamped velocity messages.
    * Restructure the twist_mux yaml file to be more legible, remove the parameters that are overwritten by the launch file anyway
    * Put use_stamped back just for the sake of being explicit. Add use_stamped directly to the launch file
    * Fix the tests to catch unsupported platforms & accessories
  * Rename ign_ -> gz_ for gazebo dependencies, comment-out missing jazzy dependencies (for now)
