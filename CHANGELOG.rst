2.0.0 (2025-01-16)
------------------
* Add the A200 Observer backpack attachment (`#122 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_common/issues/122>`_)
  * Add the A200 Observer backpack attachment
* [clearpath_platform_description] Fixed Ridgeback R100 rear light colour. (`#127 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_common/issues/127>`_)
* Add PTZ sim support (`#125 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_common/issues/125>`_)
  * Now that axis_camera is released via OSRF, depend on the official package, remove duplicate meshes
  * Rename Gazebo plugins for Jazzy compatibility
  * Modify Axis camera URDFs to using the axis_camera meshes. This lets us control the gazebo topics. Fix the GZ topic names. Camera data is now visible in the simulation
  * Add joint controllers for the pan & tilt actuators. This provides velocity control over the simulated camera
* Add a placeholer URDF for the AMP mount, update meshes (`#123 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_common/issues/123>`_)
  * Add a placeholer URDF for the AMP mount; STL & final dimensions to come at a later date
  * Default to treaded wheels, flip all the wheel models so the treads visually go in the correct direction
  * Update the top plate, chassis, livery, smooth wheel, and status light meshes. Closes CPE87-2102
  * Catch unsupported platforms/accessories in vcan generation tests
* A300 (`#118 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_common/issues/118>`_)
  * Add A300 meshes
  * Move A300 meshes
  * Add A300 URDF
  * Added A300 control configuration files
  * Remove unstamped parameter, deprecated
  * Use clearpath_hardware_interface LynxHardware

* Add collision tags for MoveIt to avoid these objects (`#108 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_common/issues/108>`_)
* Remove all references to clearpath_platform
* Add collision tags for MoveIt to avoid these objects (`#108 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_common/issues/108>`_)
* Update simulation support for Jazzy (`#117 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_common/issues/117>`_)
  * Rename gazebo plugins to use new gz nomenclature instead of ign/ignition. Use stamped velocity messages.
  * Restructure the twist_mux yaml file to be more legible, remove the parameters that are overwritten by the launch file anyway
  * Put use_stamped back just for the sake of being explicit. Add use_stamped directly to the launch file
  * Fix the tests to catch unsupported platforms & accessories
* Rename ign\_ -> gz\_ for gazebo dependencies, comment-out missing jazzy dependencies (for now)
